Missing big features:
* fast capture
* timer
* panorama
* HDR
* Sequential shots
* fcam like functionality for QtCamera (precise control over frame parameters)
* Zoom images in post capture
* portrait mode for image and video modes.
* point of exposure.
* Night mode (dim viewfinder)
* Left handed mode (reverse layout and UI)
* Plugins:
  - Get hold of viewfinder frames to analyze them and render whatever to the screen
  - A way to add GStreamer elements to viewfinder filters and draw to the screen
  - A way to define "submodes" for stuff like panorama or HDR.
