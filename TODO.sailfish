* touch focus. is it really working?
* zoom. Are we rendering the viewfinder correctly?
* face detection is broken
* No preview for captured images and recorded videos (Might be possible with GStreamer 1.3+)
* icons:
  - review and resize needed ones
  - 1080p video resolution has no icon
* sound effects for video recording are not working.
* assist light sometimes does not switch off
* src/sailfish/soundvolumecontrol.cpp is just a template
* Use H264 for video
* probably more...
