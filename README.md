Project consists of: A Qt wrapper library for camerabin2 and QML bindings on top of it.

A camera application written used the QML bindings.

The library is meant to run whenever GStreamer and camerabin2 are available.

Configuring it for any target hardware is a matter of creating proper GStreamer sources, sinks and encoders and a bunch of configuration files.
